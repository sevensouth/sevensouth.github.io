	--our purpose-- and who's behind this site. 
	
	</b></p><br>

		<p><b>
Our Purpose is 3 fold: </b>
</p>       1. It's about helping you discover (really uncover) the reason you're on 
	      this planet (Hint: It's usually closer at hand than we ever imagine...) <br><br>

	   2. Then we help you understand the evironment --the mountain 
          you'll be climbing-- which is the 21st century.<br><br>

       3. And lastly is the practical, rubber-meets-the-road, knowledge 
          and skills acquisition that is often the missing ingredient -- the 
          most essential aspect of preparation to ensure success.<br><br><br>
<!--insert icon for -->

		<p><b>
Now, let's drill deeper... </b>
</p>  <b>First,</b> it's about Hope. 
      Finding your purpose, helps you find yourself -- where you're going 
      in life. And that brings hope like nothing else. 
      If you have ever been lost, you know what I mean. Because.. <br><br>

      Once you know where you're going in life, you have clarity. 
	  And that is true hope. <br><br>

      Let's call this - your destination. Like when you go traveling. 
      This is where you want to end up. <br><br><br>
	  
	  
	  <b>Second</b>, we aim to help you better understand how our world has and 
      is continuing to to change, morph, upgrade and evolve. (Hint, 
      technology is at the heart of the matter). <br><br>
      
	  Don't worry. This does NOT mean you need to become a geek. 
      But, we all need to understand how techology is reconfiguring 
	  the way we live and work. And we need to master if we're going 
	  to pursue our purpose.<br><br>

      Let's call part ii, the map. With this we have the lay of the land. 
      And we understand the territory we'll be passing through on the 
      way to our destination. <br><br><br>


      <b>Third</b>, it's great to know where you want to go and to have a 
      map. But then there's making a decision, <br>[Yes! I'm going to do it.], 
	  and preparing... <i>and most importantly</i> setting out on our journey. <br><br>

      So, the third part of this site's mission is to help you prepare 
      for your journey. But not in some superficial, haphazard, happy-
      go-lucky or foolish manner. Rather we aim to get you fully equiped 
      with the tools, skills and strategies to succeed. <br><br>

      Take for instance if you wanted to climb a mountain, say Mount 
      Everest. It's one thing to have that as a pipe dream (What most 
      people do...), but once you've decided to climb that mountain, 
      it's time to start preparing. <br><br>

      You'll need to get in shape physically. Then, you'll need  
      equipment for the climb and training. I mean if you've never 
      climbed a mountain before, you'll have no idea what to do even if 
      you have all the best equipment in the world. so in most cases, 
      you'll need to learn some new skills.   <br><br>

      Then, you need to get to the mountain you want to climb. You need 
      transportation to the foot of the mountain. 

      After that, there will be logdging and food. You might want to hire a 
      porter to lighten the load you carry up the mountain. <br><br>

      Anyway, the important point in this analogy is that there's a 
      practical side to pursuing your purpose and dream. We're here to 
      help with that too. <br><br>

      And this is the path to a truly abundant and meaningful life. One that 
      can be full of freedom, creative expression, useful work/service 
      and, yes, wealth in all its forms -- spiritual, intellectual and 
      of course, material.

		<p><b>
Our Team </b>
</p> Even though this site it new, we've been working on the material for years. 
     On the ideas and concepts, but mostly on ourselves. On finding our own 
     missions, embracing and actualising them. <br><br>

     It's not always easy, and it DOES take some time for must of us, 
     but it is oh so worth it...<br><br>

     The worst thing you can do is spend your life climbing the wrong 
     ladder. Then get to the end and realise when its too late, you've 
     chased all the wrong things. <br><br>

     In fact, you've spent your life chasing after the very things you 
     didn't really want and none of the things you REALLY DID want. 
     You were dupped. Tricked. Ahhh, it's so easy to be seduced and 
     diverted. It takes persistance, humility and honesty to find your 
     purpose and then focus to stay on course. <br><br>

     But there is no more important journey or one that will bring you
     more happiness (and prosperity in every way) than finding and 
     pursuing your purpose. Trust me. <br><br>

     I knew my purpose in a general sense years before I finally 
     embraced it and decided to seriously pursue it. It's our human
	 nature. <br><br>

     Some times we fight the very thing we want most. For more, 
	 see blog entry: I know what I want to do. Now what..? [link]

		<p><b>
 And lastly...

The Name </b>
</p> 7 Degrees South refers to being being 7 degrees under. When you're 
     in the minus column of life, underwater or you are starting out--
	 when you're not even AT it, but-- far BEHIND the Starting Line. <br><br>

     7 Degrees South also refers being physically at 7 degrees south of 
     the equator -- which is where much of this site has been produced.
	 And importantly..<br><br>

     7 Degrees South refers to a quality of seeing things from a 
     different perspective, having a different or heterodox approach to 
     life and problem solving. <br><br>

     It also struck me as just catchy and memorable. I hope you agree.
