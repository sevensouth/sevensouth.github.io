<b>My Story in 3 vignettes</b>...<br>

<b>1. The Early Years: Japan. </b><br>
The first period of my work life was in Japan. Adventures and misadventures. First as an English teacher 
and later as a salaryman. This is where I got my start teaching English. It’s also where I worked in two 
Japanese companies --both times—- as the only non-Japanese.  <br><br>

<b>2. Back in the USA:</b> <br>
After 7 years in Japan, I spent the next 8 back in the USA, learning, working and studying. This is where <br>
I had the opportunity to work as a recruiter, in IT as part of a team of programmers and in finance <br>
advising others on wealth management. <br><br>

<b>3. Returned to Asia:</b> <br>
I followed one of my dreams: To live, work in and learn about China. A fascinating place. My odyssey has <br>
continued to Korea, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Libya and currently Indonesia.<br><br>

<br>
<b>Personality: I am..</b><br>
Results oriented<br>
Value substance over form, and <br>
Thrive in a casual, serious, experimental, innovative work environment <br><br>

<b>Character: I am..</b><br>
•	<b>Bulldogged:</b> Determined, Focused & Persistent. Once I set my mind to something, I generally do what<br>
ever it takes to succeed. <br><br>

•	<b>Resourceful:</b> Also known as Creativity-in-Action. When I don’t have all the answers (which is
 most of the time :)), I melt my thinking, reform it and then find the tools and know-how to get the job done. <br><br>

•	<b>Understanding of 21st Century:</b> Living around the world and working in many fields has helped me grasp the changes 
taking place in our world and how to help people make the transition. <br><br>

•	<b>Communication:</b>  I can break complex ideas and technologies down and make them easy to understand. I can talk with people 
from nearly any culture or background and people instinctively trust me. <br><br>

•	<b>Eclectic:</b> I am curious. I’ve learned about a variety of things over the years: From Database to Hypnosis. <br>
From Religion to Medicine. From Music to Manicures. I’ve learned language, psychology, computer science and finance. <br><br>
