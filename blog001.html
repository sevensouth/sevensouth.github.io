<p/><font face= "verdana"><b>I know what I want to do. Now what..?</b><br><br>
It's HARD to follow your bliss - even after you know what it is. Why is that?<br><br>
The mind, which always seeks to protect us, has its ways. Not always good mind you. 
It goes on strange twists and turns like a meandering, winding mountain road. <br><br>

We spend our lives yearning for something. Sometimes we're not even sure what for. But we pine, yearn, kick and scratch, gnaw and bite at the bit. There is something our soul aches and reaches for, but can't ever quite seem to reach it. 
Then one day, like waking from a dream, it all comes into focus. we see it right in front of us, but we hesitate. Sometimes we just reach out and take it. That is when we find happiness --and strangely enough-- usually the success that has also eluded us for so long. 
But wait. <br><br>

It's not that easy. Because, remember, I said "sometimes". Often, maybe unfortunately, most of the time, even after we find the thing we want to do, we yearn to do, the thing our soul calls out for in the dark of the cold and lonely night. We stop. We hesitate. We DON'T just reach out and seize the day. 
We wait. We wonder. We try 13 other things. None of which go well or satisfy. <br><br>

<b>What are we doing? What's wrong with us?</b><br>
At this point, we know exactly what we want to do and why. What's stopping us?<br>

Well, I can't answer for you because each of us is different. But if you're anything like me, you might be afraid of your dream. 
Afraid of my Dream!?? What does that mean?<br><br>

Well, think about it. For starters, it may be really big. And you may have been told all your life that you are small. Too small. 
You may fear, that it's just too big, too wonderful, too great for someone as lowly and insignificant as you. So, you run away. You hide your head in the sand of all kinds of other duties, "goals" and activities. 
<br><br>
In fact, they may all be very good. Very noble. Maybe indeed, you ARE genuinely interested, talented in and would enjoy those things to some extent, but as you've probably often heard...
By doing those things, you leave the one great thing you could do UNDONE. That is you sacrifice the GREAT for the merely good. 
<br><br>
And life is too, too short to spend it doing things that don't make you feel 1000% alive. But remember, we are not always rational creatures. 
We're full of a thousand competing emotions that usually pull ous in 16 different directions at once. 
<br><br>

<b>So what to do?</b><br>

First, recognise what's happening. Awareness alone can often be curative. Second. Laugh. That's right. Laugh at your silliness. 
It's very very healthy and humbling to laugh at your own foibles and faults. 
<br><br>
But what I'm not running away from my dream, you ask?
<br><br>
What if it's more practical. What if I want it and I'm willing to do anything. I'm focused. My eyes are wide open. No games. No running. 
And yet, I just can't see a way to bridge the gap? What if it just looks IMPOSSIBLE. 
<br><br>
And let's tack one more on right here, since it's related. What if there is some guilt also involved? 
Because many years ago, when I first met my dream, one of my first reactions was guilt. 
<br><br>
It went something ike this: "How can I be so selfish as to think I have the right to go pursuing my dream. I have responsibiliites. People depend on me. I can't just go off and .... 
So, if guilt (or something similar) doesn't stop you, then maybe it's some very real and ISEEMINGLYI insurmountable barriers that stand in the way and make you want to give up before you even start. 

<br><br>
Or its your own brain which has become your own worst enemy as it tries to protect you by using fear. 
<br><br>
<b>Let's go back to that a minute - shall we?</b>
<br>
Because this fear, this paralysing fear has many different offshoots and variations. I'll just mention a couple. 
<br><br>
One of them, which is one of the most insideous. It is insideous because it lurks at the dark corners of your mind. And we are often only obliquely aware of it. Yet it's effect is real and devestating. 
Once I was finally able to articulate it: It went something ike this: If, this thing is My Dream, and if I go and attempt this wonderful, beautiful, life changing thing, and IF IT DOESN'T work out... If it or I fail, I will have nothing left to live for. I'm not sure what I'll do...
<br><br>
Wow! How can you even begin to fight something like this? What I call a shadow fear. 
The answser to all these is to first get them out on the table. What is hidden away, swimming around, bouncing off the walls of our brain as it goes back and forth like a lion pacing it cage, can make us crazy. 
<br><br>
The first step it to acknowledge it. Ahhhh... But wait. It's so easy at this point to then run yourself into the ground and beat yourself up for all this crap. 
Hint. Everyone, and I mean everyone, great and small alike have these kinds of fears and problems. The only difference is in HOW we decide to deal with them. 
<br><br>
<b>Let me repeat. All great people throughout history, have had to deal with their unique bag of silly and stupid fears. </b>
<br><br>
So, with your fears out on the table, you at least see what you're up against. 
<br><br>
<b>But here's the great news.</b> <br>Once all this stuff is out in the light of day, it suddenly gets smaller and sillier. That is, outside your head, on the table where you can examine it with your thinking brain, much of it just fades away like a dream upon waking as you see the utter silliness of it all. 
<br><br>
And what remains, you can then deal with in a more measured way. 
<br>
No, there are no easy answers. But you can also rest assured, you are in good company with your silly, stupid, sordid, industrious and paralysing fears. 
Now, your job is to deal with them. And it is the decision that "I WILL" deal with them that takes us --IN ONE STEP-- HALFWAY TO VICTORY. 
<br><br>
And then you can get on with figuring out how to realise your dream and do the thing, the ONE thing you've been put on this earth to accomplish. The one thing, more than anything else, you have to share with this planet. 
Something no one else can do exactly like you. 
<br><br>
<b>Hang in there. Fears can be overcome.</b> First get them out where you can see them, then you can deal with them so you can get on with your dream.
